  [FAIL ] M11 first chart ledger:s02 enters at 11.8s - outside 0-10s; WARN no sound cue within 1.5s of the enter at 11.8s (no evidence species in the timeline - every dock treated as a chart candidate); window 0-10s (E44 short: the page rolls out on the hook - the chart is the mechanism by 0:10)
          E24 / doc 29 s9.29 (long form) + E44 (short): the first chart enters 0:08-0:20, or 0:00-0:10 on a short, annotated on its divergence, with a sound cue
  [WARN ] M17 s02: method arap, centroid 27.5 % W, axis 40.7 deg, area 0.01, min det -0.182 - FAILS centroid, axis, area, det J <= 0 - the morph does not read as one thing changing (move the prop onto the chart's box, keep its axis, keep its area)
          P47 T3 / the brief B4 [DERIVED: :390-396]: a morph reads as one thing changing when its centroid moves <= 6 % of W, its dominant axis turns <= 15 deg and its bounding area keeps >= 60 % - measured in the player by measure_morph.py
  [WARN ] M34 1 reading(s) over 5 instants probed: sname:-9.9% Japan across its own line s0:h at 0:16 (s02), 120 px from the line's end (a direct label sits within 118)
          K9, the operator's reasoning items C05-R023 ("every text element must be in the collision ledger, including the ones that were already there"; "labels are all crashing with the lines") and C09-R003 ("the callout owns its position"; measure the rendered boxes, never estimate), and the two defects no row caught on normal-for-which-bridge review-v1 (docs/agent-memory/operator/casebook/ring-on-the-tip-label: the dashed 123% ring painted over "x3.9 Federal debt" at 0:57; .../name-on-the-neighbour-line: "10-year" written across the 30-year line at 0:19, the 4.83% arc clipping it). M28 pairs labels with labels; this row puts every text box against every mark's stroke and every series polyline, from the page's own DOM (probe.py --gate). The operator, 2026-09-13: "bracket should probably be able to bypass that rule" - a bracket's or a figure's own text on the series it measures is allowed (on a DIFFERENT series' line it still FAILs); and "a ring or callout drawn over a label doesn't automatically fail, if the point is to draw a ring or highlight around that label - but we have spotlight tools that can provide more clarity while demanding less accuracy" - a mark over its OWN target's text (the datum it rings: a bar's value, its pill, a figure or bracket at that datum) WARNs and names the spotlight (E56: a ring circles a number or a point on a chart); over any other text it FAILs
  [PASS ] M01 longest still stretch 1.3s at 0:16
          doc 29 s8.19 / s9.25 stillness ceiling
  [PASS ] M02 0 stretches > 8s (working target)
          doc 29 s9.25
  [PASS ] M03 longest wait for evidence to enter: 12s from 0:00 (no docks at all)
          doc 29: evidence every 15-45s, every phase incl. P1 and P6 (E21)
  [PASS ] M04 2 distinct plates; target runtime/12s = 1
          doc 29 s9.13 plate density
  [PASS ] M05 no plate over the 20s hold
          doc 29 s9.13 as amended by E69 (2026-09-12): the hold is legal while the FRAME LIVES - the ceiling's two-dock condition was written when a world was a still and only a card could move on it
  [PASS ] M06 12 caption pages = 38/min, 4.5 words/page
          s9.15 r7 / build_caption_pages 4-6 words
  [PASS ] M08 timeline declares cap_mode; every stretch over the ceiling carries stage captions (counted as events above)
          doc 29 s9.25 caption STAGE mode (E21: captions ARE the motion when nothing else moves)
  [PASS ] M09 no scene stacks two camera moves (punch | focus_zoom | pull_back) or a camera move over Ken Burns
          doc 29 s9.27 precedence / s9.28 C3: one camera move per window
  [PASS ] M10 no still stretch > 6s begins in the first 60s
          E24 / doc 29 s9.29: stillness inside the opening minute - 4-6s in the first 30-60s
  [PASS ] M12 no chart dock spans a scene boundary or holds past 10s (6s in the opening minute)
          E25 / doc 29 s9.30: the chart is the proof, not the homework
  [PASS ] M14 no camera move (punch | focus_zoom | pull_back) overlaps a card entrance or a badge reveal
          47 s2 G-a / doc 07 Pillar 4 (saccadic suppression): a camera move may not overlap an evidence build - the eye is blind during the move
  [PASS ] M15 no species window overlaps a page's retract
          E40 #5 (operator, 2026-09-05): no spotlight on a spiral out - no species window overlaps a page's retract
  [PASS ] M16 longest gap between visual events 1.3s at 0:16; 0 gap(s) over 2.5s
          doc 49 s49.6 / operator 2026-09-05: the short-form gate is the pulse - no gap between visual events over 2.5 s; no ceiling
  [PASS ] M18 no run of bit-identical frames over 0.50s (227 frames at 12 fps, 0:00-0:18); longest 0.00s at 0:00
          E49 / P47 T5: nothing ever goes truly still - a run of identical rendered frames over 0.5 s is a freeze (measure_frozen_frames.py); R26-13: read PER LAYER too - the page, the docks and the captions each on their own (frame-hashes.<layer>.json, the shell's ?layers= switch), because a caption boiling over a frozen page passes the whole-frame hash (Tokyo v2: 1036 distinct frames of 1066, M18 PASS, the pages still). The whole-frame verdict is still reported.
  [PASS ] M21 every ledger page leaves or un-draws within 8s of its last data mark: s02 2.1s (0:16 -> 0:18)
          E50 (operator 2026-09-07): a chart's deployed life is 6-8 s from its last data mark on average, 12 s at most - then it un-draws or becomes the next thing
  [PASS ] M25 no settled card on the chart's data, on a line of the page's ink or in the caption strip over 5 instants probed; smallest type read 14.5 CSS px on a phone (floor 11) | INFO, listed not scored (CSS px on a phone): source (the citation) 9.4
          E45 s1 (the compiler's `place`: a card parks in the page's quiet space, never over the plot, the title, the source line or the caption's anchor) / E52 (the page CITES: the citation rides the park) / E60 - the three defects of 2026-09-10, refused from the page's own DOM (probe.py --gate)
  [PASS ] M27 no card reads over a ledger page's ink over 5 instants probed (0 not-parked card reading(s) measured)
          E63 (operator 2026-09-11, on the Tokyo cut at 0:09.5-0:10.5: "docking over the plate while it's drawing is not a good standard practice ... as a rule we should probably use better handling now that we can manipulate scale/depth/placement easier"; widened the same evening, on the read that came back over the finished chart: "im confused, because you just left the dock over the chart now too. something went backwards"): a card that has not parked yet may not sit on a ledger page's INK, drawing or finished - the READ moves (the compiler's `read_moved` / `read_deferred`), never the word. The page's own INK is what the row scores (the data, the labels, the citation - M25's boxes): since E65 the placer may put a card in the plot's own empty ROOM on purpose, so the plot box is the WARN tier and the ink is the FAIL. A PARKED card is E45's contract and M25's row. Read from the page's own DOM (probe.py --gate)
  [PASS ] M28 no two of a page's own labels touch, and the value row keeps half a figure of air, over 5 instants probed (135 label pair(s) checked)
          R26-53 (the operator, 2026-09-11: "why are we now crashing text?") - the Tokyo Meta page's four values "$665 $633 $604 $577" touched each other and the callout's pill on bar 4 covered bar 3's label, on the approved build and on every side build before f67c5ed, and no row saw it: M25 reads cards over ink, M26 the value's height, and the probe's `overlaps` carried card-vs-ink and pill-vs-rail only. E28 (a chart reads right at a glance): no two of a page's OWN labels may sit on each other, and the row that fits them (lpFitValues / lpPillBand) leaves half a figure of air between them. From the page's own DOM (probe.py --gate)
  [PASS ] M31 no world-taking transition leaves the stage empty (0.0% of the runtime empty)
          R26-66 / P53 T2, measured with measure_stage_gaps.py: a transition that TAKES the world (a suck, a melt) left the stage with no world on it for 3.1 s while the narration was already on the next sentence - 8.9% of a 69 s short. The DIP is the one transition licensed to empty the stage (a dip is a world change); everything else hands off, and the page that follows an inked arrival (enter=axes / built) measures 0.
  [PASS ] M32 1 boundaries read frame by frame: no flash, no jump, no black outside a dip's core
          P54 T9 (the operator, 2026-09-13: 'it's really the flash before or a second black frame that we're looking for'): measure_seam_frames.py seeks every boundary frame by frame; near-black = mean luma < 8 [MEASURED on the approved Japan short's six dips: darkest 0-6, cuts never under 52]. A declared dip's own dark core is the design; black anywhere else at a seam is the fault the operator found by hand twice (2026-09-05, 2026-09-12)
  [PASS ] M33 0 pointing phrase(s), each with a page, dock or card on stage
          P54 T9 (the operator, 2026-09-13: 'gating for narration without the chart on screen is probably valid'; 2026-08-29: 'you open on the "spike" but you don't have the spike ons creen, you talk about charts without the charts on screen'): measure_spoken_visuals.py - a pointing phrase needs a page, a dock or a card on stage. WARN until the approved shorts show a real example (their one hit is a figure of speech)
  [PASS ] M44 every world plate holds at least 6s (1 world plate(s), floor 6s)
          sub-6s-plate (the operator, 2026-08-29, ledger 69ff558bdf67; docs/operator-ledger/TRIAGE-DIGEST.md: "the baloon dock doesn't even make sense ... why do we have a plate less than 6 seconds long?"): a world plate under 6 s is a flash the eye cannot take in, and one that also carries a DOCK asks the eye to read evidence inside that flash. BUILD-PIPELINE says only "under ~8s one piece or none" and nothing checked plate length. Read from the timeline's own scenes - no browser, no render
  [INFO ] M07 runtime 19s has no full minute to rank - M07 not run (no silent skip)
          E21
  [INFO ] M26 no bars page printed a value at any of the 5 instants probed - nothing to check (a line page's numbers are its tags, not a height)
          E28 (a chart reads right at a glance: a bar's height IS its value) / E53 (the scale and the value are printed at every instant) / R26-40 - the printed number and the DRAWN height, read against the scale the page itself prints, from the page's own DOM (probe.py --gate). R26-39 was exactly this mismatch: 303 px of bar at "0.00 %"
  [JUDGE] J01 every savor beat holds its picture (card up, badge lit), never a bare plate with a drift
          doc 29 s9.25 #3

RESULT: 1 FAIL / 2 WARN / 22 PASS / 1 JUDGE / 2 INFO
